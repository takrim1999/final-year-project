\section*{Abstract}
This project investigates attention mechanisms for ocular disease classification using fundus images from the ODIR\textendash 5K dataset. We compare a strong convolutional baseline (EfficientNet) against an attention\textendash augmented variant employing the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM). Our pipeline parses ODIR metadata, prioritizes Hypertension labeling where present, and enforces robust stratified splits to ensure all target classes appear in validation and test sets. Experiments demonstrate that image\textendash specific attention improves several classes, while Hypertension remains challenging due to limited single\textendash label prevalence and ambiguity in diagnosis text. We provide full training/evaluation artifacts (curves, confusion matrices, and metrics) to support reproducibility and future extensions, including multi\textendash label learning and targeted augmentation for rare classes.
