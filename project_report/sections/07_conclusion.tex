\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
We presented a practical comparison of an EfficientNet baseline and an EfficientNet+CBAM attention variant on ODIR\textendash 5K. Attention improved several classes, and the pipeline reliably exported artifacts for transparent analysis. Hypertension remains difficult in single\textendash label settings; future work will explore multi\textendash label training, better hypertension\textendash specific augmentation, and backbone scaling (B3+) to further improve macro F1.
